# [Near Earth Object Finder](https://dkallen78.github.io/neo-finder/neoIndex.html)

This is mostly an experiment to play with some of NASA's public APIs.

## Description of the Math

### Drawing the Orbits

I'm getting a list of the NEOs that are making their closest approach to Earth today and modeling their orbits in relation to the rest of the inner Solar System.

My first API call gives me the list of NEOs which I use to make a bunch of API calls for the individual asteroids. Included in this second batch of data is the information I use to model the orbit.

I start with NEO.orbital_data.semi_major_axis (a) and NEO.orbital_data.eccentricity (e) to calculate the semi-minor axis (b) so I can draw the ellipse that will represent the orbit with an SVG element.

b = a * √(1 - e²)

With this info I can draw my ellipse (rx = a, ry= b).

Next I find the distance from the center of the ellipse to its focus (c)

c = √(a² - b²)

This tells me where to draw the Sun and it gives me the focus of the orbits of the other planets.

Once I've drawn an orbit of appropriate size and shape, I use CSS transformations to make sure it's properly positioned in the 2D plane.

First I rotate the Longitude of the Ascending Node (Ω). Assuming an ideal elliptical orbit, Ω is how much that orbit is rotated about the sun (focus) counter-clockwise away from the first point of Aries (what I like to call Celestial East).

transform: rotate3d(0, 0, 1, -Ωdeg);

Next I adjust for the inclination of the orbit (𝘪). The inclination is how much the orbit is tilted from Earth's orbital plane.

transform: rotate3d(0, 1, 0, -𝘪deg);

The final transformation I apply is to account for the Argument of Periapsis (ω), or in this case Perihelion. Perihelion is the point when the orbiting object (asteroid in this case) is closest to its primary (Sun). ω is how much the point of perihelion is rotated away from its "ideal" position.

transform: rotate3d(0, 0, 1, -ωdeg);

### Asteroid Speed

This bit wasn't too technical, but I wanted the speed of all the objects to be relative to each other. The animation works by moving the asteroid by a set degree every 5 ms. I calculate the x and y coordinates with two equations:

x = a * cos(α)

y = b * sin(α)

I increment α by a set ammount (θ) every 5 ms, but to make the speeds relative to each other I divide θ by NEO.orbital_data.orbital_period (T)

θ / T

making objects with a lower period move faster, and objects with a higher period move slower.
